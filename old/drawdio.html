How to Solder The Drawdio

This is the Drawdio, the obnoxious singing pencil.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-23.09.28.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-633" alt="2013-04-24 23.09.28" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-23.09.28-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

You're going to solder it. Yes, you.

If you know what you're doing, you'll find that all the component values are printed on the board.  Do your thing, then hit Command-F for "Monkey Butts" for the special assembly instructions.

This is a nice, straightforward kit project. Grab basic soldering gear, cutters, and a pair of scissors. The board is small, so helping hands (or a PanaVise if you're a G) are good to have. To maximize instant gratification once finishing your pencil, grab a sheet or two of paper.

Prepare your workstation, tin the tip, and get ready to get the lead out! If you want to brush up on technique, read the comic. Grab a MakerBar member for help. We love the attention.

Some components are polarized - they have a 'right way' and a 'wrong way'. Most aren't. I'll tell you whether a component needs special placement; otherwise assume you can insert it any which way.

First, we'll solder the resistors. Resistors are the peanut-shaped thingies and may be blue or beige. We'll start with Resistor A, the 10kΩ resistor, marked RA on the board. The 10kΩ resistor has the bands colored brown, black, orange.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-21.56.21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-635" alt="2013-04-24 21.56.21" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-21.56.21-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Bend the leads (wires) of the resistor and slot it into the RA space. All resistors are nonpolarized, so it doesn't matter which direction they faces.If you splay the leads of the resistor out, it will stay in place when you flip the board over to solder it.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-21.56.57.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-636" alt="2013-04-24 21.56.57" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-21.56.57-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Use good soldering technique, letting the iron heat both the pad (metal ring) and lead before you apply solder. Trim the ends off with a diagonal cutter.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-21.58.24.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-637" alt="2013-04-24 21.58.24" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-21.58.24-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Now let's move on to Resistor B, RB. This resistor is 300kΩ - our blue thin-film resistor has the color bands orange, black, black, orange. Just like RA, bend the leads, slot them into place, and solder!

Next are resistors 1 and 2. R1 is 20MΩ, color bands red, black, blue. R2 is 100Ω, color bands brown, black, black.

You can slot R1 and R2 into place and solder them at the same time. Remember to trim those leads!

&nbsp;

Next up are the ceramic capacitors, C1 and C3. These are not polarized, and can be blue, beige, or maroon.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-22.17.58.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 22.17.58" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-22.17.58-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

C1 is 680pF - look on the side for tiny text that says 681. In most of our kits, ours are blue. C2 is 0.1µF - look on the side for tiny text that says 104.

Slot the capacitors into place, spread the leads, solder them, and trim!

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-22.17.58.jpg"> </a>

Next, we'll do C2, the electrolytic capacitor. This component IS polarized - the longer leg is the anode, or + side.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.28.15.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-669" alt="2013-04-24 22.28.15" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.28.15-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Slot C2 into its space, making sure the longer anode leg is in the pad labeled with the little +. Bend the capacitor so it lies flat against the board, spread the legs, solder, and trim.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.31.31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-670" alt="2013-04-24 22.31.31" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.31.31-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

&nbsp;

Next up is Q2, the transistor. Slot Q2 into its space, making sure the flat side matches the silhouette printed on the board. Transistors are easy to burn crispy - leave about 1/4&quot; of headroom between the transistor and the board, and solder it as quickly as possible.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.31.39.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-671" alt="2013-04-24 22.31.39" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.31.39-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

&nbsp;

Now it's time for the NE555, the black microchip. This part is sensitive to heat and static, so avoid touching the chip's pins and solder as quickly as possible. Find the circle or notch on the top of the chip and align it with the notch on its silhouette on the board.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.34.31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-672" alt="2013-04-24 22.34.31" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.34.31-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Bend a leg on a couple of opposite corners to hold the chip in place.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.36.23.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-673" alt="2013-04-24 22.36.23" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.36.23-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Solder each leg as quickly as you can. If you have trouble with a leg, step away for a few minutes to let the board cool down before you continue.

Monkey butts.

The speaker is a little tricky. Start by heating up the two blobs of solder and pour solder directly onto the speaker's pads until it has two little ball-shaped mounds of solder. It may help if you gently lift the iron as you apply more solder.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.41.12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-674" alt="2013-04-24 22.41.12" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.41.12-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Repeat for the SPK+ and SPK- pads on the board. Apply solder until you get a nice ball/mound on the pads. Don't be afraid to overload it - we want MAD SOLDER.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.42.24.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-675" alt="2013-04-24 22.42.24" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.42.24-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Place your speaker on the pads, so each side's solder blobs are touching. Hold it in place.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.43.32.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-676" alt="2013-04-24 22.43.32" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-04-24-22.43.32-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Gently use your soldering iron to melt both balls of solder, sticking the speaker to the pad! Repeat for the other side and your speaker is attached.

&nbsp;

Apply some solder to the tabs on both sides of the board.

Cut the copper tape in half. Peel about 1/2&quot; of paper off one of the pieces, tape it over a solder blob, and press it down with the iron until the solder melts. You'll know it when it happens.

Apply some solder from the pad onto the tape.

Repeat this for tape on the other side, facing the other direction.

Put a battery in the battery holder and stick the battery holder into its holes. Touch the copper strips. If you hear silly noises, your circuit works! If it doesn't, call over a MakerBar member to help you troubleshoot.

Strap the completed board to the supplied 2B pencil.

Take the paper off the copper tape and wind it along the pencil.

Drive the included pointy metal thingy through the top copper tape into the lead of the pencil. You probably got a thumbtack. When I wrote these instructions, I had to improvise. Solder the tack to the copper - you may need to use a whole bunch of heat.

Sharpen that bad boy, throw in a battery, and you're ready to rock!

Technically, you're ready to squeal. Draw a nice, thick, juicy line, stick your finger on it, and touch the other side with the pencil. Drawing! Audio! Drawdio!
