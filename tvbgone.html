How to Solder the MakerBar TV-B-Gone

Before getting started, prepare your workstation. Plug in your soldering iron, place it in the stand, wet the sponge, and tin the tip.  If you're familiar with soldering, you'll find that everything you need is printed on the board. The resistors have the same values, and you have one PNP and four NPN transistors. Command-F for "Fizzwidget" to jump straight to special assembly instructions.

It's easier to build a circuit board if you solder in the shortest components first. We're going to build this board in height order.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.08.45.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.08.45" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.08.45-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

First, the resistors, marked R1 and R2 on the board. You have two of these - they're beige or blue and peanut-shaped. Bend the leads (wire legs) so they'll fit into their slots…

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.11.46.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.11.46" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.11.46-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

…and slot them into place. They're the same value (1kΩ), so it doesn't matter which one goes in R1 and R2. They're nonpolarized, so it doesn't matter which way they're facing. Turn the board over and bend the leads to hold them in place.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.12.58.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.12.58" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.12.58-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Solder the leads in place and trim off excess. Remember that the soldering iron must touch both the pad and the lead to make a good joint.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.15.06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.15.06" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.15.06-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Here's a close-up. Note how the joints are shiny and volcano-shaped, and the leads are trimmed nice and close. If your joints are dull or blobby, apply more heat with the iron.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.16.46.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.16.46" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.16.46-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Now for C1, the 0.1µF ceramic capacitor. This is a yellow or blue blobby component with two leads sticking out of the bottom.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.18.03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.18.03" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.18.03-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Stick C1 into place, bend the leads, solder it, and trim the excess. Like the resistors, this capacitor is nonpolarized, so there's no 'right direction'.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.20.28.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.20.28" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.20.28-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

The next component is our small colored indicator LED. This goes into place at the bottom-right of the board. An LED *IS* polarized. It has a right way and a wrong way. One leg of your LED is longer - that is the anode, or + end. There is also a flat notch cut into one side of the LED's lens. That side is the cathode, or - end.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.22.00.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.22.00" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.22.00-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Stick the LED into place, being REALLY CAREFUL to line up the longer anode leg with the + on the board. Bend the legs and solder it in place.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.23.21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.23.21" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.23.21-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Next is the resonator, a blue or yellow component with three leads. This goes in an oblong space on the right side of the board.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.25.18.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.25.18" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.25.18-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

The resonator is nonpolarized - stick it in, bend the leads, you know what to do.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.27.55.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.27.55" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.27.55-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

The next component is C2, the electrolytic capacitor, a cylindrical thingy. The electrolytic cap is polarized - like the LED, its long leg is the + or anode end. Insert the electrolytic cap into its slot, being careful to align the anode with the + marked on the board. Bend the electrolytic cap so it's flush with the board, then bend the leads and solder it in place.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.33.42.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.33.42" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.33.42-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Next step is the chip socket. Slot this guy into place, and be careful that the notch on one end of the socket lines up with the notch printed on the board.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.34.06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.34.06" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.34.06-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

To keep the socket from falling out when you turn over the board, bend two legs on diagonally opposite sides of the socket flush against the board. Solder those legs first and your chip will stay rock-solid as you finish the others.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.36.38.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.36.38" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.36.38-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Transistors! Let's start with the ones marked NPN. These are marked 2222, 3904, etc. There are four of these, but we'll solder one at a time.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.37.37.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.37.37" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.37.37-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Slot one into an NPN space, making sure the flat side of the transistor matches up with the silhouette printed on the board. Don't press it flat against the board - leave about 1/4&quot; of headroom. Transistors are damaged by heat, so solder it as quickly as you can. If you have trouble making a joint, step away from your workstation for a few minutes to let the transistor cool off. Be sure to trim off the leads!

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.44.05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.44.05" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.44.05-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Solder the other three NPN transistors into place. Remember to read the markings on all of them; make sure you don't solder a PNP transistor in there! It'll destroy things and make MakerBar members sad.

You should have one PNP transistor left, labeled 2907 or 3906. Solder this into the transistor space marked PNP.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.49.06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.49.06" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.49.06-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Now for the business end - the infrared blaster LED's! You have two styles - wide ones and laser-like narrow ones. Let's solder in the wide ones first - they're either tinted blue or smaller in size.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.52.14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.52.14" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.52.14-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Insert them into the slots at the edges, bending them flat to lie off the edge against the pads. Make sure the anode leg is on the pad labeled with +!

Now here for a weird part - solder these on the TOP. Do this quickly and do not touch the clear LED lens with the soldering iron.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.54.23.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.54.23" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.54.23-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Flip the board over, bend the legs downwards, and solder the leads on the bottom.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.58.33.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.58.33" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.58.33-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Repeat for the narrow-beam LED's in the center. Remember to keep the longer anode leg on the same side as the + icon!

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.59.58-e1367453019809.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 19.59.58" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-19.59.58-e1367453019809-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Take the momentary switch (pushbutton) and snap it into place. The switch is not polarized and will not fit into place if you try to insert it sideways. The button snaps into place - just solder the legs and it'll stay put.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-20.05.30.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 20.05.30" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-20.05.30-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Now for the battery case! Cut the case's wires to about 2&quot; long, strip about 1/4&quot; of the wire, twist it, and apply solder directly to the wire.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-20.06.29.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 20.06.29" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-20.06.29-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Thread the red wire (the whole wire, not just the tip) through the hole on the right. Thread the black wire through the hole on the left. Insert the tinned tips through the pads, then flip the board over and solder the wires into place.

<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-20.11.31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="2013-04-24 20.11.31" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-24-20.11.31-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Finally, let's install the chip! You'll notice that the chip has a notch or circle on one end. Slot the chip into place, making sure that this indicator faces the notch on the socket.

Testing time! Install batteries, take aim at a television, hit the button ONCE, and make sure it works. Do not continue if the TV-B-Gone doesn't work. Ask a MakerBar member for help finding and fixing the bug. If it works, you are done! Double-stick tape the board to the battery case, head down to the local sports bar, and wreak havoc!

Lookin' good! Killer soldering, dude!
