How to Solder the Joule Thief

First, collect your components and read the Learn to Solder comic to brush up!
Make sure your tip is tinned and clean.

First, we'll solder the inductor and resistor. Both have a distinct peanut shape, but the inductor is much larger than the resistor. Bend the leads (legs) so they'll fit in their spots on the board, insert them into the board, and spread the legs. There's no 'wrong way' - it doesn't matter which direction they're facing.

Here's a picture from the other side. The bent legs hold the components in place while you solder. Solder the components into place and trim the leads.

Bend the leads of the diode and insert it into place. Unlike the resistor and inductor, the diode has a "right way". Line up the black band around the tip of the diode with the white line on the PCB.

Bend the legs and solder it into place.
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=429" rel="attachment wp-att-429"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-429" alt="DSCN1563" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1563-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

You have three capacitors - identify which is which using the tiny code printed on them. The 10uF is marked 106, the 150pF is marked 151, and the 100nF is marked 104.

Slide the capacitors into place, spread the legs, and solder them in place. They can go in either way, but be extra careful about putting the correct value in the correct place!
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=431" rel="attachment wp-att-431"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-431" alt="DSCN1567" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1567-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Now, let's move on to the transistors. Transistors are sensitive to heat - we're going to leave them about 1/4&quot; off the board and solder carefully to avoid scorching them.

Identify the BC327 and bend the center lead out like so.

Slide the BC327 into place, making sure to leave lots of headroom. It shouldn't touch the PCB!
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=435" rel="attachment wp-att-435"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-435" alt="DSCN1573" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1573-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Splay the legs in different directions...
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=436" rel="attachment wp-att-436"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-436" alt="DSCN1575" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1575-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

And solder into place.
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=437" rel="attachment wp-att-437"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-437" alt="DSCN1576" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1576-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Repeat for the BC337. BE EXTRA CAREFUL YOU'RE SOLDERING THE RIGHT TRANSISTORS!

Now, let's move on to the LED's. LED's have a right direction and a wrong direction. There are two ways to tell which side is which - the cathode's leg is shorter than the anode, and the cathode has a flat side. Line the short leg up so it's facing the flat side of the icon printed on the PCB. 
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=439" rel="attachment wp-att-439"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-439" alt="DSCN1581" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1581-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Slide the LED in so it's flush with the PCB. Double-check that the flat side of the LED lines up with the flat side of the icon!
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=440" rel="attachment wp-att-440"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-440" alt="DSCN1584" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1584-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

You can splay the legs, solder this LED, and move on to the other three. Alternately, you can insert all four together.
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=441" rel="attachment wp-att-441"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-441" alt="DSCN1585" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1585-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

You can bend the legs diagonally to hold all four in place simultaneously.
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=442" rel="attachment wp-att-442"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-442" alt="DSCN1588" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1588-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Solder and clip, and check your work for blobs or missed joints. Once we put the battery holder on, it won't be easy to fix things.
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=443" rel="attachment wp-att-443"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-443" alt="DSCN1589" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1589-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Snap the switch into place.
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=444" rel="attachment wp-att-444"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-444" alt="DSCN1592" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1592-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

It doesn't take much solder to hold the switch on - just a touch on each leg will do it.
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=445" rel="attachment wp-att-445"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-445" alt="DSCN1594" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1594-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Flip your board over and line up the battery holder with the + and - icons on the PCB. You may need to bend them a little to get it to fit. Solder on the other side and clip the legs.
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=446" rel="attachment wp-att-446"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-446" alt="DSCN1597" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1597-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

You're done! Admire your handiwork!
<a href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?attachment_id=447" rel="attachment wp-att-447"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-447" alt="DSCN1598" src="http://blog.makerbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1598-1024x768.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Snap in a dead battery and realize you've just soldered some electronics!
