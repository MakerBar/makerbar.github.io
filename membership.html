<p>MakerBar is a member supported organization, meaning we depend on your help to operate. We're a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, which means your donations are tax deductible.</p>

<p>Becoming a member is easy. Setup a recurring donation through PayPal or your money transfer system of choice (chase quickpay, dwolla,...) (our email for receiving funds is treasurer@makerbar.com). Then send an email to <a href="mailto:membership@makerbar.com">membership@makerbar.com</a> and we'll get you set up.</p>

<p>We have several tiers of membership.</p>

<p><em>Associate membership</em> is pay-what-you-want membership that gives you an email address and access to our member mailing list, chat system, and other online systems we give to members, and lets us know that you support our mission.<p>

<p><em>Full membership</em> is $110 a month, and gives you all the benefits of associate membership, plus a key, a vote at member meetings, and a shelf to keep your projects on.</p>

<p><em>Student membership</em> is open to all full-time students and provides most of the perks of full membership, but at a discount to help with student budgets. Email <a href="membership@makerbar.com">membership@makerbar.com</a> for details.</p>

<p>Have questions we haven't answered here? Interested in corporate membership or some other arrangement? Reach out to <a href="membership@makerbar.com">membership@makerbar.com</a> and we'll be happy to help.</p>
