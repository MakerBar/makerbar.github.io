<p>Instructables and Dremel have selected MakerBar as one of its locations to host a build night to learn Dremel and create awesome things!</p>

<p>We will be Dremel-ing and writing up our projects for others to learn via doing through the power of sharing knowledge. After a 15 minute safety demonstration, we will have five Dremel rotary tools with accessory kits and three Dremel reciprocating tools to make a mountain of awesome projects! We have a lot of things at MakerBar that could serve as the foundation for projects, but we want your ideas, your participation, and your projects to shine here. Bring any materials you may have and transform them into science, art, or something unique.</p>

<p>All are welcome, and the event will begin at 7:30 with our safety demonstration.</p>

<p>Come out and build things with Dremel tools and learn how to make your projects a reality fast!</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

<p>Sign up on the meetup!
